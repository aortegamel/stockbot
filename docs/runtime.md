# Stockbot runtime: needle harness → kernel scheduler

Launch: `bun run stockbot` runs `bun needle-harness/scripts/needle.ts`,
which refreshes the tool catalog via `scripts/tool_bridge.py describe` and
serves the Next.js harness. The harness posts prompts to
`needle-harness/app/api/agent/route.ts`, which runs
`runKernelAgent` (`needle-harness/lib/agent/kernel.ts`): one
`app/research/kernel_worker.py` call per request, which persists the prompt
verbatim as the objective, runs the intake (SEC filing metadata + search
snippets per resolved ticker plus one exact-text Exa search, settled with
`continuation=False` so it admits evidence but never resolves), builds a
verbatim digest, runs Reasoner decompose over raw query + digest (optional
tickers/corrected_query hints feed at most one more intake round), then JEV
proposal disposition → per-proposal nodes, then `app/research/scheduler.py
run` over ready nodes. Each intake round logs an `intake_digest` decision.
Progress lines (`session`, `intake_start`, `intake_done`, `reasoner_*`,
`tool_start`, `tool_done`) stream as `progress` events; prod forwards a
stripped `working` stage to keep the UI stall watchdog fed.

Architecture: the kernel scheduler owns the agent loop (JEV selects over
the whole registry every round, Needle fills arguments only, tools execute
via `app/tool_runtime.py` against canonical `app/tools.py`). Thesis
monitoring runs the same scheduler in-process via
`app/thesis/runner.py run_trigger` (injectable `_RUN_KERNEL` seam; the
default runs the shared graph fan-out via `run_graph_prompt` +
`scheduler.run`). No OMP/Pi entry or superseded loop remains.

`app/research/runner.py` is a deterministic eval harness only (retired live
loop kept as a test helper): the scheduler owns orchestration, the kernel
owns evidence, PIT, freeze, and stages. Production and eval orchestration
never call `run_live`/`resume_live`.

Live golden (opt-in only, never CI): `bun run verify:hedgefund-live` runs one
golden scenario through the production kernel path with real SEC/FINRA/Exa
credentials (`HEDGEFUND_LIVE=1`, `SEC_EDGAR_IDENTITY`, `FINRA_CLIENT_ID` /
`FINRA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `EXA_ENABLED=1` + `EXA_API_KEY`) and re-exports the
read-only harness-viewer projection. Without the opt-in flag it exits 2.
